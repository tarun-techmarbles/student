I thought about all of the possible solutions for solving this challenge and settled on this flow:

User will submit the form, as usual.
In the form processing PHP, I use cURL to execute a POST transmission to a PHP script on the customer's server.
The remote script would do a MySQL INSERT query into the customer's private database.
This solution worked quite well so I thought I'd share it with you. Here's how you execute a POST using the PHP CURL library.

Refer to the specific page for the protocol in use for a list of options which can be set. (e.g. php.ini value user_agent used by the http wrapper). On the Windows platform, be careful to escape any backslashes used in the path to the file, or use forward slashes. <?php $handle = fopen("c:\\folder\\resource.txt", "r"); ?> mode.
